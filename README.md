## What are candlestick patterns?

Candlestick patterns are graphical representations of price movements
over a specific period of time. They are used by traders to identify
trends, reversals, and support and resistance levels. Candlesticks are
made up of four main components: the open, high, low, and close prices.

-   The open price is the price at which the market opens for the
    period.
-   The high price is the highest price reached during the period.
-   The low price is the lowest price reached during the period.
-   The close price is the price at which the market closes for the
    period.

The body of the candlestick is the area between the open and close
prices. The wicks are the lines that extend above and below the body.
The length of the wicks indicates the volatility of the market during
the period.

## How to use candlestick patterns

Candlestick patterns can be used to identify a variety of market
conditions, including trends, reversals, and support and resistance
levels. By studying the shape and position of candlesticks, traders can
make informed decisions about when to enter or exit trades.

Some of the most common candlestick patterns include:

-   Hammer: A hammer is a bullish reversal pattern that occurs when the
    price opens significantly lower than its close, but rallies to close
    near its high.
-   Doji: A doji is a neutral pattern that occurs when the open and
    close prices are virtually the same.
-   Engulfing pattern: An engulfing pattern occurs when a candlestick
    completely engulfs the previous candlestick.
-   Morning star: A morning star is a bullish reversal pattern that
    consists of three candlesticks -- a long bearish candle, followed by
    a small-bodied candle or doji, and then a long bullish candle.
